We believe that open source software is a critical part of geodistributed systems. Currently we are collaborating on two projects:

- [Honu]({{< ref "content/oss/honu.en.md" >}} "honu"): A library for embedded database replication using anti-entropy
- [Concur]({{< ref "content/oss/concur.en.md" >}} "concur"): An API for Consensus
